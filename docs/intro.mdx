# Tutorial Intro

:::danger
Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.
:::

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```
:::caution
You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.
:::

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```
:::info
The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.
:::

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

## Exporting components

:::tip

You can export components from your MDX files. See 
section Exporting components in [MDX and React](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react)

:::

:::note
I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
:::

import Highlight from '@site/src/components/Highlight';

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and 

<Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight>

## Using Custom Fields in MDX

See [Custom Configurations](https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration#custom-configurations) for more information.

import UseCustomFields from '@site/src/components/UseCustomFields';

<UseCustomFields />
